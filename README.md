# MIS510-Linear-Regression

In this Critical Thinking Assignment, you will install R Markdown, explore and summarize a dataset as well as create a linear regression model. Your assignment submission will be an R Markdown generated Word document.

Install R Markdown by following the instructions found in the Course Information folder.  

Create a new R Markdown file by performing the following steps.

Open R Studio
Select File | New | R Markdown
Use Module 3 CT Option 1 as the Title
Use your name as the Author
Select the Word output format
Delete all default content after the R Setup block of code, which is all content from line 12 through the end of the file.
Explore Boston housing in the BostonHousing.csv file (found in the Module folder or by clicking "Next" at the bottom of this page)  by performing the following steps.

Apply what you learned in Modules 1 and 2 about data exploration by selecting and running appropriate data exploration functions. Run at least five functions.
For your assignment submission, copy your commands into your R Markdown file.
Include R comments on all your code.
Separate sections of R code by using appropriate R Markdown headings.
Fit a multiple linear regression model to the median house price (MEDV) as a function of CRIM, CHAS, and RM by following the process under Example: Predicting the Price of Used Toyota Corolla Cars in section 6.3.
Use the R code example shown in Figure 6.3.
Hint: You will need to remove the categorial variable CATâ€¦MEDV prior to fitting the multiple linear regression model.

Create a scatter plot with the plot() function with the following attributes.
Use MEDV as the y-axis
Use the most significant attribute as the x-axis.
Use the abline() function to add a linear regression line to the scatter plot. Use the y-intercept as the y value and the factor value of the most significant attribute as the slope value.
For your assignment submission, copy your commands into your R Markdown file.
Include R comments on all your code.
Separate sections of R code by using appropriate R Markdown headings.
Use the R Markdown Knit drop-down menu to select Knit to Word to create the Word document for your assignment submission.
